# ActionScript Bug: Missing Parentheses in Function Call

This repository demonstrates a common error in ActionScript: forgetting to include parentheses when calling a function.  This seemingly small mistake can lead to unpredictable results, as the compiler may not always detect this issue.

The `bug.as` file contains the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.as` file provides the corrected code.

This example is useful for understanding potential pitfalls and improving code quality in ActionScript projects.
